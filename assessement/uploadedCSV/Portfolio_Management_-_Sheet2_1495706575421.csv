 Dover's current stock price (P ) = $35.00
 The expected price in one year (P ) is $39.00

 Historical average S&P 500 return = 12.0%.
 Dover Holdings stock is:",C,M,Numerical,Single Choice,Portfolio Management,"To determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued, we need to compare the expected return (or holding period return) and the required return (from Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM).
 Step 1: Calculate Expected Return (Holding period return)
 The formula for the (one-year) holding period return is:
 HPR = (D + S - S ) / S , where D = dividend and S = stock price.
 Here, HPR = (1.50 + 39 - 35) / 35 = 15.71%
